Tokenisation

Objectives:

    1. Implement a tokeniser using the byte-pair encoding algorithm
    2. Explain how BPE generates a vocabulary of subword tokens

Overview:

This is a simple tokeniser from scratch. This tokeniser has the job of turning raw text into "tokens", in essence building a vocabulary that can be used by a language model.
